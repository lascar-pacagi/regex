(** [Regenerate.arbitrary (module W) (module S) ~compl ~pp ~samples alpha]
    creates a {!QCheck} generator that generates triples containing
    a {!regex} and a list of positive and negative samples.

    @param W is a module implementing operation on words. See {!Word} for some predefined modules.
    @param S is a module implementing a data-structure enumerating words. See {!Segments} for some predefined modules. We recommend {!Segments.ThunkList}.
    @param skip specifies how many samples should we skip on average. Default is [8].
    @param compl specifies if we generate regex containing the complement operator.
    @param pp specifies how to print individual characters.
    @param alpha describes the alphabet as a list of characters.

    Character classes are not supported.

      we assume that the rest of the segments will be infinitely empty and
      stop.
